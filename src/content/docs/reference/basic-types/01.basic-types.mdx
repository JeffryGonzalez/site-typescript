title: Basic Types
---

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

 The basic types are String, Number, Boolean, Symbol, and BigInt.
- Strings can be delimited by single quotes, double quotes, or backticks.
- Numbers can be integers or floating-point numbers. (They are always 64-bit floating-point numbers.)
- Booleans can be true or false.
- Symbols are unique and immutable values, often used as object property keys.
- BigInt is a built-in object that provides a way to represent whole numbers larger than 2^53 - 1.

## Declaring Instances of Types

You have to declare a variable or constant before it can be used in TypeScript.

### Using `const`
You can use the `const` variable to create a name for a value that cannot be reassigned.

When you use `const` you *must* initialize the value.

```typescript del={"X":10} showLineNumbers
    const name: string = "John Doe";
    const name1: string = 'John Doe';
    const name2: string = `Jane Doe`;
    const age: number = 19;
    const average:number = 19.23587;
    const isActive: boolean = true;
    const s:symbol = Symbol();
    const weight: bigint = BigInt(1000);

    name = 'Puttintane';
```

<Aside type="caution">
`const` does not make a value immutable, it just makes it so you can't reassign a value to that variable.
For example, a `const` array can still have its elements changed, and a `const` object can still have its properties modified.
```typescript
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4); // This is allowed
const obj = { name: 'John' };
obj.name = 'Jane'; // This is also allowed
```
</Aside>

### Using `let`

Let creates a name for a changeable value. In other words, you can reassign a value (of a compatible type) to this name without error.

With `let` variables you *may* initialize them, or defer initializtion until later.

```typescript showLineNumbers
let name: string = 'Joe';
const age:number = 22;
name = 'Joseph';

let message:
if(age >= 21) {
    message = 'Let them in';
} else {
    message = 'Turn them away';
}
console.log(message);
```

### Initialized `const` or `let` Values Type Can Be Inferred

TypeScript will infer the type of an initialized variable, so you don't have to do it.

```diff typescript
-   const name: string = "John Doe";
+   const name = "John Doe";

-   const age: number = 19;
+   const age = 19;

-   const isActive: boolean = true;
+   const isActive = true;

-   let hourlyRate:number = 12.22;
+   let hourlyRate = 12.22;
```

## Unknown and Any Types 

The `unknown` type is a type-safe counterpart to `any`. It can hold any value, but you must perform some type of checking before you can use it.
The `any` type can hold any value, but it does not provide type safety, meaning you can use it without any checks.

```typescript showLineNumbers
let value: unknown;
value = "Hello, world!";
value = 42;
value = true;
value = { name: "Alice" };
value = [1, 2, 3];
// To use the value, you must check its type first
if (typeof value === "string") {
    console.log(value.toUpperCase()); // This is safe
} else if (typeof value === "number") {
    console.log(value.toFixed(2)); // This is also safe
} else {
    console.log("Value is not a string or number");
}
let anyValue: any;
anyValue = "Hello, world!";
anyValue = 42;
anyValue = true;
anyValue = { name: "Alice" };
anyValue = [1, 2, 3];
// You can use it without any checks
console.log(anyValue.toUpperCase()); // This is unsafe if anyValue is not a string
console.log(anyValue.toFixed(2)); // This is unsafe if anyValue is not a number
```

## Summary
We will look at type checking in more detail later. But some general guidelines:

- For most application code, prefer to allow TypeScript to infer types.
- Use `unknown` when you need to handle values of different types but want to ensure type safety.
- Use `any` sparingly, or not at all. As it bypasses type checking and can lead to runtime errors.
