title: Defining Types
---
import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

A "type" is a *category* of an acceptable domain of values. We know, for example, that when we declare a variable of type `string`, it can only hold values that are strings, such as `"hello"` or `"world"`.

That is a pretty *broad* type, because it can hold *any* string value. But we can also define *narrower* types that only allow certain values or structures.

<Aside type="note">
Starting to "think in types" is a key part of becoming a TypeScript developer. It can be hard to get started, but it is worth the effort.
</Aside>

For example, if we wanted a string-like type that only allows the values `"red"`, `"green"`, or `"blue"`, we could define a type like this:

```typescript
type Color = "red" | "green" | "blue";

let myColor: Color;
myColor = "red"; // OK
myColor = "yellow"; // Error: Type '"yellow"' is not assignable to type 'Color'

```
This is us saying that anything of type `Color` is a *subset* of some literal strings that define the permissable values. The `type` keyword is used to define a new type (called an *alias*), and the `|` operator is used to create a union type that allows any of the specified values.

So we are saying that values of type `Color` can only be one of the three specified strings. If we try to assign a value that is not one of those, TypeScript will give us an error.

A nice side-effect of this is that not only is the TypeScript compiler able to check that we are using the correct values, but it can also provide *autocomplete* suggestions in our editor. So if we start typing `myColor = "`, the editor will suggest `"red"`, `"green"`, and `"blue"` as possible completions.

<Aside type="note">
There is a cool trick you can do with this if *all* you want is the autocomplete suggestions, but also want to allow any string value.

```typescript
type ColorChoices = 'red' | 'green' | 'blue' | (string & {});

const color1: ColorChoices = 'red';
let color2: ColorChoices;
color2 = 'avocado';
```
</Aside>

## Defining Object Types
In TypeScript, you can define the structure of an object using an *interface* or a *type alias*. This allows you to specify what properties an object should have and their types.
```typescript
interface Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    isEmployed: boolean;
}
type Car = {
    make: string;
    model: string;
    year: number;
};
const person: Person = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30,
    isEmployed: true
};
const car: Car = {
    make: "Toyota",
    model: "Camry",
    year: 2020
};
```

You can also use an `interface` to define a type:
```typescript
interface Point {
    x: number;
    y: number;
}
const point: Point = {
    x: 10,
    y: 20
};
```

<Aside type="note">
You can use either `interface` or `type` to define object types. There really isn't a lot of difference between the two. 

When you use an `interface`, there is a *slight* performance advantage **for the compiler**, but no difference at runtime (as types are erased during compilation).

I *personally* prefer using `types` for two reasons:
1. The notion of `interface` exists in other languages, and while there is some overlap, they are much different in TypeScript.
2. Interfaces have a strange behavior where you can define them multiple times in a module, and they will extend one another. I just think that is weird.

Bottom line, you do you.
</Aside>

## Extending Types 

```typescript
type Person = {
    name: string;
    age: number;
};
type Employee = Person & {
    employeeId: number;
    department: string;
    salary:number;
};
const employee: Employee = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30,
    employeeId: 12345,
    department: "Engineering",
    salary: 75000
};
```

### Discriminated Unions
A discriminated union is a powerful way to define a type that can be one of several different types, each with its own properties. You can use a common property (called a "discriminator") to determine which type it is.

```typescript
type Person = {
    name: string;
    age: number;
};
type Employee = Person & {
    kind: "employee";
    employeeId: number;
    department: string;
    salary:number;
};
type Customer = Person & {
    kind: "customer";
    customerId: number;
    purchaseHistory: string[];
};
type User = Employee | Customer;
const user1: Employee = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30,
    employeeId: 12345,
    department: "Engineering",
    salary: 75000
};
const user2: Customer = {
    name: "Bob",
    age: 25,
    customerId: 67890,
    purchaseHistory: ["item1", "item2"]
};
function handleUser(user: User) {
    if (user.kind === "employee") {
        console.log(`Employee: ${user.name}, Department: ${user.department}`);
    } else {
        console.log(`Customer: ${user.name}, Purchases: ${user.purchaseHistory.join(", ")}`);
    }
}
handleUser(user1); // Employee: Alice, Department: Engineering
handleUser(user2); // Customer: Bob, Purchases: item1, item2
```

## Anonymous Types
You can also define types on the fly without giving them a name. This is useful for one-off types that you don't need to reuse elsewhere.

```typescript
const person: { name: string; age: number; isEmployed: boolean, email: string } = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30,
    isEmployed: true
    email: 'Alice@aol.com'
};

function sendMessage(to: { name: string; email: string }, message: string) {
    console.log(`Sending message to ${to.name} at ${to.email}: ${message}`);
}
sendMessage({ name: "Bob", email: "bob@example.com" }, "Hello Bob!");
sendMessage(person, "Hello Alice!");
```

This is an example of *structural typing*, where TypeScript checks that the object has the required properties and types, even if it is not explicitly defined as a type or interface.

## Classes 

TypeScript has great support for defining types with classes. Way more than I'll show here, actually, because we don't tend to use a lot of this style of coding in Angular.

### A Bit About Classes, Scope and JavaScript

TypeScript has an affordance where you can declare fields in a class constructor, and TypeScript will automatically create the corresponding properties on the class instance. This is a nice shorthand that saves you from having to declare the properties separately.

However, it is just a TypeScript "thing". If you are using TypeScript to produce JavaScript that others will use (without TypeScript), there is no protection for those `private` properties.



```typescript
class Person {
    constructor(public name:string, private age:number) {}

    getInfo() {
        return `Person ${this.name} is ${this.age}`;
    }
}
```

Produces the following JavaScript code:

```javascript
class Person {
    constructor(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    getInfo() {
        return `Person ${this.name} is ${this.age}`;
    }
}
```

JavaScript also does not have field scoping modifiers. 

`public` is the default, and so isn't usually specified. 

If you use `private`, the TypeScript compiler *may* actually emit JavaScript code to simulate private properties. 

For example, with this code:

```typescript del={27}
class BankAccount {

   private balance: number;
   constructor() {
    this.balance = 0;
   }

   public deposit(amount:number) {
    this.balance += amount;
   }

   public withdraw(amount: number) {
    this.balance -= amount;
   }
   getBalance() {
    return this.balance;
   }
}

const myAccount = new BankAccount();

myAccount.deposit(125.23);
myAccount.withdraw(100.00);

console.log(myAccount.getBalance());

myAccount.balance = 5000;

console.log(myAccount.getBalance())
}
```
You *shouldn't* be able to access the `balance` property directly, but you can. The TypeScript compiler will show an error, but the JavaScript code will still allow it.

In 2022, JavaScript introduced a new way to define private properties using the `#` syntax. This is not TypeScript specific, but it is worth noting because it is now part of the JavaScript language.

```typescript
class BankAccount {

   #balance: number;
   constructor() {
    this.#balance = 0;
   }

   public Deposit(amount:number) {
    this.#balance += amount;
   }

   public withdraw(amount: number) {
    this.#balance -= amount;
   }
   getBalance() {
    return this.#balance;
   }
}

const myAccount = new BankAccount();

myAccount.Deposit(125.23);
myAccount.withdraw(100.00);


console.log(myAccount.getBalance());

// myAccount.#balance = 5000;

console.log(myAccount.getBalance())
```

This will produce a JavaScript error if you try to access the `#balance` property directly, as it is now truly private to the class. 

As a matter of fact the TypeScript compiler, if you set the `target` to equal to earlier than `ES2022`, it will emit JavaScript code that uses a "wrapper" to protect these properties.

That same code above (for the class) will emit the following JavaScript:

```javascript
"use strict";
var __classPrivateFieldSet = (this && this.__classPrivateFieldSet) || function (receiver, privateMap, value) {
    if (!privateMap.has(receiver)) {
        throw new TypeError("attempted to set private field on non-instance");
    }
    privateMap.set(receiver, value);
    return value;
};
var __classPrivateFieldGet = (this && this.__classPrivateFieldGet) || function (receiver, privateMap) {
    if (!privateMap.has(receiver)) {
        throw new TypeError("attempted to get private field on non-instance");
    }
    return privateMap.get(receiver);
};
var _balance;
class BankAccount {
    constructor() {
        _balance.set(this, void 0);
        __classPrivateFieldSet(this, _balance, 0);
    }
    Deposit(amount) {
        __classPrivateFieldSet(this, _balance, __classPrivateFieldGet(this, _balance) + amount);
    }
    withdraw(amount) {
        __classPrivateFieldSet(this, _balance, __classPrivateFieldGet(this, _balance) - amount);
    }
    getBalance() {
        return __classPrivateFieldGet(this, _balance);
    }
}
```

See [Private Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Private_properties) for more information on this new feature.

<Aside type="note">
My recommendation is to use the `#` syntax for private properties in TypeScript, as it is the most future-proof and aligns with the latest JavaScript standards. 

Using the constructor shorthand is fine, but be aware that it is just a TypeScript feature and does not provide any runtime protection in JavaScript for anything other than `public` (because `public` is the default). I rarely use it.

There is no notion of `protected` in JavaScript, but it is in TypeScript. It is a way to allow access to properties and methods from subclasses, but not from outside the class hierarchy. Again, it will note emit any JavaScript code to enforce this, so it is purely a TypeScript feature.

A couple points:
- using the `#` syntax, you will get a runtime error if you try to access a private property from outside the class. (Normally you would get an `undefined`).
- The rule is relaxed in the developer tools. You *Can* access private properties in the console, but you will get an error if you try to access them in your code.

### Classes Implementing Interfaces

You can also use interfaces to define the structure of a class. This is useful for ensuring that a class adheres to a specific contract.

```typescript
  it('example 2 - class with inteface', () => {
    interface ProvidesInformation {
      getInfo(): string;
    }
    class Employee implements ProvidesInformation {
      name: string;
      position: string;

      constructor(name: string, position: string) {
        this.name = name;
        this.position = position;
      }

      getInfo() {
        return `${this.name} is a ${this.position}.`;
      }
    }

    class Product implements ProvidesInformation {
      getInfo(): string {
        return 'This is a product.';
      }
    }

    const employee = new Employee('Bob', 'Software Engineer');
    const product = new Product();

    function displayInfo(item: ProvidesInformation) {
      return item.getInfo();
    }
    expect(displayInfo(employee)).toBe('Bob is a Software Engineer.');
    expect(displayInfo(product)).toBe('This is a product.');
  });
```

However, keep in mind that TypeScript does not enforce the implementation of interfaces at runtime. 

It is *structurally typed*, meaning that as long as the class has the required properties and methods, it will satisfy the interface.

The following code will work just as well:

```typescript
 it('example 2 - class with inteface', () => {
    interface ProvidesInformation {
      getInfo(): string;
    }
    class Employee {
      name: string;
      position: string;

      constructor(name: string, position: string) {
        this.name = name;
        this.position = position;
      }

      getInfo() {
        return `${this.name} is a ${this.position}.`;
      }
    }

    class Product {
      getInfo(): string {
        return 'This is a product.';
      }
    }

    const employee = new Employee('Bob', 'Software Engineer');
    const product = new Product();

    function displayInfo(item: ProvidesInformation) {
      return item.getInfo();
    }
    expect(displayInfo(employee)).toBe('Bob is a Software Engineer.');
    expect(displayInfo(product)).toBe('This is a product.');
  });
});
```
