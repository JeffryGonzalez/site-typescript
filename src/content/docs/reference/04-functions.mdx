title: Functions
---

There are two main ways to define functions in TypeScript: function declarations and arrow functions. Both can be used interchangeably, but arrow functions have some differences in how they handle the `this` keyword.


## Function Declarations
A function declaration is a named function that can be called later in the code. It can take parameters and return a value.

```typescript
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
}
console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
```

Using the `function` keyword, will "hoist" the function declaration to the top of the scope, meaning you can call it before it is defined in the code.

```typescript
console.log(subtract(5, 2)); // 3
function subtract(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a - b;
}
```

The return type of the function can be inferred and is often left off in application code:

```typescript
function multiply(a: number, b: number) {
    return a * b; // TypeScript infers the return type as number
}
let answer:number;
answer = multiply(4, 5); // answer is inferred as number
```

## Arrow Functions
Arrow functions are a more concise way to write functions. They are often used for short, one-liner functions or when you want to preserve the `this` context from the surrounding scope.

```typescript
const divide = (a: number, b: number): number => {
    return a / b;
};
console.log(divide(10, 2)); // 5
```
Arrow functions can also be written in a more concise form if they have a single expression:

```typescript
const square = (x: number): number => x * x;
console.log(square(4)); // 16
```
Arrow functions are not "hoisted" like function declarations, so you must define them before you use them:

```typescript
console.log(modulus(10, 3)); // Error: Cannot access 'modulus' before initialization
const modulus = (a: number, b: number): number => {
    return a % b;
};
```

## Function Scope 

Functions are visible in the scope in which they are defined. If you define a function inside another function, it is only visible within that inner function.

```typescript
function outerFunction() {
    function innerFunction() {
        console.log("Hello from inner function");
    }
    innerFunction(); // This works
}
outerFunction();
// innerFunction(); // Error: innerFunction is not defined outside outerFunction
```

A function (either a function declaration or an arrow function) declared at the "root" of a source code file (called a "module") is available 
throughout the module.

We will see below how to export functions, types, and values from a module and import them into another module.


## Function Types 

You can define the type of a function using a function type annotation. This is useful when you want to pass functions as arguments or return them from other functions.

```typescript
type MathOperation = (a: number, b: number) => number;
function performOperation(op: MathOperation, a: number, b: number): number {
    return op(a, b);
}
const add: MathOperation = (a, b) => a + b;
const subtract: MathOperation = (a, b) => a - b;
const result = performOperation(add, 5, 3);
const result2 = performOperation(subtract, 5, 3);
const result3 = performOperation((a, b) => a * b, 5, 3);
console.log({result, result2, result3})); // { result: 8, result2: 2, result3: 15 }
```
