### <Badge text="NO" variant="danger" /> Never commit `node_modules` to Source Control

It isn't your code to track changes on, and different packages get installed on different operating systems or even different versions of the same OS. Just don't do it.

### <Badge text="YES" variant="success" /> Always commit `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to Source Control

These *must* be tracked.


### <Badge text="YES" variant="success" />Only use NPM Install For Individual Packages 

After an application is created, *never* run `npm install` without specifying a package name. 

### <Badge text="YES" variant="success" /> Use `npm ci` for Updating Dependencies On Your Machine 

If a new `package.json` or `package-lock.json` is fetched from source control, run `npm ci` to install the exact versions specified in `package-lock.json`.
This will not modify the `package-lock.json` file and use the versions specified in it *only*.

### <Badge text="MAYBE" variant="caution" /> Periodically Run NPM CI Anyhow 

Just good housekeeping. You might have missed a change to the dependencies.

### <Badge text="YES" variant="success" /> Use `npm outdated` to See What Needs Updating
Run `npm outdated` to see what packages are out of date. This will show you the current version, the wanted version (the latest version that satisfies the version range specified in `package.json`), and the latest version (the latest version available on the NPM registry).

### <Badge text="YES" variant="success" />              sUse `npm update` to Update Packages Within the Version Range Specified in `package.json`
Run `npm update` to update packages to the latest version that satisfies the version range specified in `package.json`. This will modify the `package-lock.json` file to reflect the new versions.

### <Badge text="MAYBE" variant="caution" /> Use `npm install -D <pacakagename>` To Install a Development Dependency 

Run `npm install -D <packagename>` to install a package as a development dependency. This will add the package to the `devDependencies` section of `package.json` and update `package-lock.json`. It doesn't mean *much* for Angular applications, but it is a good practice to separate development dependencies from production dependencies.

### <Badge text="MAYBE" variant="caution" /> Use `npm install <packagename> --legacy-peer-deps` To Install a Package That Has Peer Dependency Conflicts

But this means you have to *test*. Angular is *pretty* stable these days. Most packages that are compatible with Angular 19 will be compatible with Angular 20. But you have to *test*.

### <Badge text="MAYBE" variant="caution" /> Consider Using *overrides* in `package.json` to Force Specific Versions of Packages

This is a more advanced topic, but sometimes a package you are installing has a dependency on a package that is out of date or has a security vulnerability. You can use the `overrides` field in `package.json` to force a specific version of a package to be used, regardless of what other packages specify. Use this with caution, but it can help in a pinch. [Overrides at NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#overrides)

### <Badge text="MAYBE" variant="caution" /> Avoid Global NPM Packages

Global NPM packages can cause version conflicts and make it difficult to manage dependencies. If you need a package globally, consider using `npx` to run it without installing it globally. If you must install a package globally, use `npm install -g <packagename>` but be aware of the potential issues.
